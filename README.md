- I had issues seccuring my api keys. For reasons unknown to me they didn't work in the production environment(heroku) even after setting those variables on heroku so I had to unsecure them even though I know that is not a good practice but I had to because time was not on my side.

- I also forgot to use version control. I remembered half way through

- Firebase Firestore as Database
- Auth0 as Authentication System
